  description: My dog named 'Q√ºity' passed away on February 25 so I decided to make a song in her memory. My brother and I found her abandoned about 12 years ago, so I calculate that she died with about 14 or 15 years old, we adopted and gave her a home, she wasn't from a special breed, but was very important to me as part of my family, she was blind in her last days and I was in her care, I'm glad she can rest now. His weird name comes from a neighbor who called her 'Queeny' but we interpreted the pronunciation in Spanish as 'Q√ºity'. There are some images and videos of her in my YouTube video.
