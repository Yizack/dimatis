  description: Positive and beautiful chill vibes to end the year ‚ù§ I made this song inspired by this fantastic painting art and it's also inspired by my song &quot;Overcoming&quot; which has been very popular these years so I decided to make something similar this time! This is my last song of the year. I wish you a wonderful end of the year, I'm immensely grateful for all the support, couldn't thank you enough, you all are the best and have a big place in my heart and life.

  description: After 5 months I'm excited to be back at making music! I've been thinking a lot about the direction of music I don't want to get stuck or behind so I'll probably try new things in the next songs but keep my &quot;Dimatis&quot; style. ‚ù§ I want to thank everyone who continues listening to me on any platform commenting, liking, adding to playlists, and sharing my music, you all motivate me to keep doing what I love to and thanks to everyone who asked me through my socials how I was doing! And about this song, every song I make has a reason for being or a feeling attached to it about what I felt at that moment while making it, it's been a year since I met the nicest and most supportive and caring person I've ever met but we are really far from each other and we hope to get together someday soon, so this a classic Dimati's melodic dubstep style song with optimistic and hopeful vibes.

  description: I made this song two weeks ago because some friends published that a friend of theirs needed to raise funds for a heart surgery, they started a campaign where they motivated several producers to donate songs for a compilation album where every earning went to the cost of the surgery, so I decided to make this song for that and try to help (even I didn't know him I just wanted to help), the campaign was a success and the goal was achieved with the help of many people, I am very proud of the chill community ‚ù§

My brother and I found her abandoned about 12 years ago, so I calculate that she died with about 14 or 15 years old, we adopted and gave her a home, she wasn't from a special breed, but was very important to me as part of my family, she was blind in her last days and I was in her care, I'm glad she can rest now. His weird name comes from a neighbor who called her &quot;Queeny&quot; but we interpreted the pronunciation in Spanish as &quot;Q√ºity&quot;. There are some images and videos of her in my YouTube video.
