- lyric: call-out
  lyrics: "
    (Wake up in the morning)<br>
    (And I ask myself)<br>
    (Thinking about where you might be)<br>
    (Cannot stop reliving when)<br>
    (You finally said goodbye)<br><br>

    Wake up in the morning<br>
    And I ask myself<br>
    Thinking about where you might be<br>
    Cannot stop reliving when<br>
    You finally said goodbye<br><br>
    
    I know it's too late<br>
    To even think about<br>
    The mistakes that we made<br>
    Can't apologize<br>
    I close my eyes<br>
    Hoping the pain will go away<br><br>
    
    And I can't seem to forget about it<br>
    No this love just won't go away<br>
    Don't think I'll forget about it<br><br>
    
    Every time the night sky is out, I'll call<br>
    When the stars come out tonight, I'll call<br>
    I call out to the moon<br>
    Call out for you<br><br>

    Call out for you<br>
    (Call out for you)<br>
    Call out for you<br><br>
    
    Reminisce the good times that we had<br>
    Those were the best days<br>
    Wishing we could go back and change the past<br>
    But I know the truth<br>
    Baby no matter what I do<br>
    You're not here<br>
    Still I look for you<br><br>
    
    And I can't seem to forget about it<br>
    No this love just won't go away<br>
    Don't think I'll forget about it<br><br>
    
    Every time the night sky is out, I'll call<br>
    When the stars come out tonight, I'll call<br>
    I call out to the moon<br>
    Call out for you<br><br>

    Call out for you<br>
    (Call out for you)<br>
    Call out for you<br><br>

    Calling for you<br>
    Babe, calling for you<br>
    To the moon<br>
    Calling for you<br><br>

    To the moon<br>
    Calling for you"

- lyric: paying-for-it
  lyrics: "
    Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br><br>

    It was a long weekend<br>
    That left me wondering if we're still friends<br>
    We were sittin' in the hallway and<br>
    I never meant for it to get this way<br>
    It was a bit intense<br>
    And now I'm wondering<br>
    You left me wondering<br><br>

    But I just couldn't keep it bottled inside<br>
    Intense feels so hard to describe<br>
    If I knew that now, you wouldn't have turned the other way<br><br>

    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm dreaming of<br>
    I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm thinking of<br>
    I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br><br>

    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm dreaming of<br>
    I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm thinking of<br>
    I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br><br>

    Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br><br>

    It's like your eyes are glued<br>
    You're so interesting in your shoes<br>
    I try to look you in the eye but it's <br>
    No use if you don't try to<br>
    So I'm taking back<br>
    Everything I said<br>
    I know I can't admit it<br><br>

    But I just couldn't keep it bottled inside <br>
    Intense feels so hard to describe<br>
    If I knew that now, you wouldn't have turned the other way<br><br>

    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm dreaming of<br>
    I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm thinking of<br>
    I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br><br>

    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm dreaming of<br>
    I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it<br>
    I never meant to turn you off<br>
    But you're the one I'm thinking of<br>
    I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it"

- lyric: fly-again
  lyrics: "
    One day I'll soar through the sky<br>
    Looking back, I wish I could see you again<br>
    In the world of unknowing despair<br>
    Some day I'll fly without pain<br><br>

    In every summer song<br>
    To being stuck in a daydream far too long<br>
    I remember back then<br>
    Now I don't know when but...<br>
    I'll feel normal again<br><br>

    I'll feel normal again<br><br>

    Someday... someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday...<br>
    Some day I'll fly again<br><br>

    Someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday...<br><br>

    Everything that I need<br>
    Is it's own coloured memory within our dreams<br>
    I've failed to see the light<br>
    I want to end this fight<br>
    Some day I'll walk with my friends<br><br>

    Someday... someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday...<br>
    Some day I'll fly again<br><br>

    Someday... someday...<br>
    Someday... someday...<br><br>

    Some day I'll walk with my friends"

  lyrics: "
    I wanna know you<br>
    Wanna feel how fast my heart would beat<br>
    If you, were close to me<br>
    I wanna show you<br>
    Wanna let you loose inside my brain<br>
    To see, if you'd run or stay<br><br>

    If you, were close to me<br><br>

    To see, if you'd run or stay<br><br>

    If you, were close to me<br>

- lyric: hold-on-to-me
  lyrics: "
    Calling<br>
    Then you stop calling<br>
    I'm not used to<br>
    Hearing the sound<br>
    Of silence<br>
    Your lips have been silent<br>
    When did you<br>
    Get filled with doubt<br><br>

    Don't go thinking love is lost<br>
    We don't have to watch it fall<br>
    We can put back together our hearts<br>
    Yeah<br><br>

    Don't be scared just take my hand<br>
    So much we can't understand<br>
    But we can't let this all fall apart<br><br>

    So easy to give it all up<br>
    When it gets a little tough<br>
    But just hold on<br>
    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Don't let go of what it was<br>
    You know you found the way<br>
    Just hold on<br>
    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Hold on to me"

- lyric: out-there
  lyrics: "
    Never ending<br>
    My search for truth<br>
    The search for you<br>
    Somewhere<br><br>

    Why?<br>
    Why cross the stars?<br>
    When we're lost in the ocean<br>
    Of our limited understanding<br><br>

    Were we mistaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br><br>

    (Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?)<br><br>

    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Who is out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br><br>

    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br><br>

    (Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>

- lyric: escape-with-you-remix
  lyrics: "
    Each day's a struggle<br>
    To keep my head down and out of trouble<br>
    Not a soul could ever pop the bubble<br>
    That she's made here<br><br>

    I'm hiding in my bed longer each time<br>
    I feel I should never leave this rest<br>
    Sleep is easier than being awake I guess<br><br>

    It's loud out of the sheets<br>
    I swear I'm doing nothing wrong<br>
    Just let me go to school<br>
    And move on with my day<br><br>

    Downtown I feel at peace<br>
    No one could ever know my name<br>
    If I could I'd find all those who feel the same<br>
    And we could all go away<br><br>

    And we could all go away<br><br>

    Dad admitted<br>
    She wasn't like this at the beginning<br>
    Just for you I've been sticking with it<br>
    But she's changed<br><br>

    Ain't no reason to blame, this happens with time<br>
    She's still be your mother when I'm dead<br>
    So when we split we'll go live in a cloud instead<br><br>

    It's overwhelming, it's killing me holding this inside<br>
    I'm just a kid, I ain't ready this is impossible<br>
    All of my memories have threatened to go<br>
    I'm too slow to keep up, I feel tied up<br><br>

    Does it mean that I've actually messed it up<br>
    I didn't realize that I could be so powerful<br>
    And even though you can avoid screwing up<br>
    There's bad luck<br><br>

    It's loud out of the sheets<br>
    I swear I'm doing nothing wrong<br>
    Just let me go to school<br>
    And move on with my day<br><br>

    Downtown I feel at peace<br>
    No one could ever know my name<br>
    If I could I'd find all those who feel the same<br>
    And we could all go away<br><br>

    And we could all go away"
