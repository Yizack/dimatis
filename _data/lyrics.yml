- lyric: fly-again
  lyrics: "
    One day I'll soar through the sky
    Looking back, I wish I could see you again
    In the world of unknowing despair
    Some day I'll fly without pain

    In every summer song
    To being stuck in a daydream far too long
    I remember back then
    Now I don't know when but...
    I'll feel normal again

    I'll feel normal again

    Someday... someday... someday...
    Someday... someday...
    Some day I'll fly again 

    Someday... someday
    Someday... someday

    Everything that I need
    Is it's own coloured memory within our dreams
    I've failed to see the light
    I want to end this fight
    Some day I'll walk with my friends

    Someday... someday... someday...
    Someday... someday...
    Someday... someday... someday...
    Someday... someday...
    Some day I'll fly again

    Someday... someday
    Someday... someday

    Some day I'll walk with my friends"

  lyrics: "
    I wanna know you
    Wanna feel how fast my heart would beat
    If you, were close to me
    I wanna show you
    Wanna let you loose inside my brain
    To see, if you'd run or stay

    If you, were close to me

    To see, if you'd run or stay

    If you, were close to me
    If you, were close to me
    If you, were close to me
    To see, if you'd run or stay

    Or stay
    If you, were close to me
    If you, were close to me
    To see, if you'd run or stay

    If you, were close to me

    To see, if you'd run or stay

    If you, were close to me
    If you, were close to me
    If you, were close to me
    To see, if you'd run

    Or stay
    Or stay
    If you, were close to me
    Or stay
    Or stay
    If you, were close to me"

- lyric: hold-on-to-me
  lyrics: "
    Calling<br>
    Then you stop calling<br>
    I'm not used to<br>
    Hearing the sound<br>
    Of silence<br>
    Your lips have been silent<br>
    When did you<br>
    Get filled with doubt<br><br>

    Don't go thinking love is lost<br>
    We don't have to watch it fall<br>
    We can put back together our hearts<br>
    Yeah<br><br>

    Don't be scared just take my hand<br>
    So much we can't understand<br>
    But we can't let this all fall apart<br><br>

    So easy to give it all up<br>
    When it gets a little tough<br>
    But just hold on<br>
    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Don't let go of what it was<br>
    You know you found the way<br>
    Just hold on<br>
    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Hold on to me<br><br>

    Hold on to me"

- lyric: out-there
  lyrics: "
    Never ending<br>
    My search for truth<br>
    The search for you<br>
    Somewhere<br><br>

    Why?<br>
    Why cross the stars?<br>
    When we're lost in the ocean<br>
    Of our limited understanding<br><br>

    Were we mistaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br><br>

    (Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?)<br><br>

    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Who is out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br><br>

    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Is anybody out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br><br>

    (Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken<br>
    Or is there other life out there?<br>
    Were we forsaken)"

- lyric: escape-with-you-remix
  lyrics: "
    Each day's a struggle<br>
    To keep my head down and out of trouble<br>
    Not a soul could ever pop the bubble<br>
    That she's made here<br><br>

    I'm hiding in my bed longer each time<br>
    I feel I should never leave this rest<br>
    Sleep is easier than being awake I guess<br><br>

    It's loud out of the sheets<br>
    I swear I'm doing nothing wrong<br>
    Just let me go to school<br>
    And move on with my day<br><br>

    Downtown I feel at peace<br>
    No one could ever know my name<br>
    If I could I'd find all those who feel the same<br>
    And we could all go away<br><br>

    And we could all go away<br><br>

    Dad admitted<br>
    She wasn't like this at the beginning<br>
    Just for you I've been sticking with it<br>
    But she's changed<br><br>

    Ain't no reason to blame, this happens with time<br>
    She's still be your mother when I'm dead<br>
    So when we split we'll go live in a cloud instead<br><br>

    It's overwhelming, it's killing me holding this inside<br>
    I'm just a kid, I ain't ready this is impossible<br>
    All of my memories have threatened to go<br>
    I'm too slow to keep up, I feel tied up<br><br>

    Does it mean that I've actually messed it up<br>
    I didn't realize that I could be so powerful<br>
    And even though you can avoid screwing up<br>
    There's bad luck<br><br>

    It's loud out of the sheets<br>
    I swear I'm doing nothing wrong<br>
    Just let me go to school<br>
    And move on with my day<br><br>

    Downtown I feel at peace<br>
    No one could ever know my name<br>
    If I could I'd find all those who feel the same<br>
    And we could all go away<br><br>

    And we could all go away"
