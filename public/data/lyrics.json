    "lyrics": "Memories spread into yellow and red and amber\nThe air is so crisp with nostalgia and bliss\nThe paths that we tread and the words that we said\nThose mornings\nStanding so tall, I remember it all\nAs the autumn leaves fall\n\nAs the autumn leaves fall\nAs the autumn leaves fall\nAs the autumn leaves fall\n\nThe seasons will change but our love stays the same\nYear to year\nI think of our plans only we understand\nThe wonders we'll see as we wander beneath those branches\nStanding so tall, I dream of it all\nAs the autumn leaves fall\n\nI remember it all\nAs the autumn leaves fall\n\nAs we become gold in the September cold, I'll warm you\nTogether we'll spin in the whimsical winds\nAs we descend, heart to heart, hand in hand\nThis moment\nStanding so tall, I'll savor it all\nAs the autumn leaves fall\n\nAs the autumn leaves fall\nAs the autumn leaves fall"
