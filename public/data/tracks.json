I have the pleasure to bring you another song with Elvya this time with a time traveler theme, get ready to be delighted with a chill-type beat using sparkly and enveloping sounds that we could probably hear during a time teleportation while everything stops around you üí´. I came up with the instrumental of this song as an idea of mine almost 3 years ago but the result never convinced me so I never released it until talking to Elvya I showed her the demo and she added that magic missing, Now it comes alive thanks to her amazing vocals as always üíú.",
