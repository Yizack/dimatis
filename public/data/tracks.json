    "description": "I didn't release a chill song after a while, for this one I experimented with a dramatic and emotional mood. Last year I couldn't make as many songs as usual so this year I have the goal of releasing a song monthly, I feel like this is going to be a year of experimenting with new stuff because I will mainly focus on old projects that have never seen light or couldn't finish for whatever reason, but don't worry, I'll keep my essence in my songs and of course, I live for melodic dubstep and I will die making melodic dubstep, I just sometimes do something different as always :) I hope you enjoy this new song and thank you all for the continue supporting my music!",

This song has a special meaning for me, 5 months ago I left behind my fear/phobia of getting on a plane, and I left my country for the first time on a 10 hours trip to France all alone, to meet my girlfriend and live with her for more than a month, everything was perfect and can't be happier. When I came back home after a hard and sobbing goodbye, I wrote the melody of this song, it makes me feel good that I'll be back with her soon again so I decided to release it before the end of the year 💙. In short, it's been a great year, both musically and personally and I will continue to bring more and better music next year.",

I remember I didn't even want to listen to it again until a good told me that it's a beautiful remix and that it would be nice to release it, and now I feel like it's such a great track, NEVER feel bad about your creations! So since I only used the vocals from the original I decided to release the instrumental on all platforms as self-release you can still listen to the remix version 💙.",

I've been thinking a lot about the direction of music I don't want to get stuck or behind so I'll probably try new things in the next songs but keep my \"Dimatis\" style. ❤ I want to thank everyone who continues listening to me on any platform commenting, liking, adding to playlists, and sharing my music, you all motivate me to keep doing what I love to and thanks to everyone who asked me through my socials how I was doing! And about this song, every song I make has a reason for being or a feeling attached to it about what I felt at that moment while making it, it's been a year since I met the nicest and most supportive and caring person I've ever met but we are really far from each other and we hope to get together someday soon, so this a classic Dimati's melodic dubstep style song with optimistic and hopeful vibes.",

My brother and I found her abandoned about 12 years ago, so I calculate that she died with about 14 or 15 years old, we adopted and gave her a home, she wasn't from a special breed, but was very important to me as part of my family, she was blind in her last days and I was in her care, I'm glad she can rest now. His weird name comes from a neighbor who called her \"Queeny\" but we interpreted the pronunciation in Spanish as \"Qüity\". There are some images and videos of her in my YouTube video.",
