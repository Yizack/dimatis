This song has a special meaning for me, 5 months ago I left behind my fear/phobia of getting on a plane, and I left my country for the first time on a 10 hours trip to France all alone, to meet my girlfriend and live with her for more than a month, everything was perfect and can't be happier. When I came back home after a hard and sobbing goodbye, I wrote the melody of this song, it makes me feel good that I'll be back with her soon again so I decided to release it before the end of the year üíô. In short, it's been a great year, both musically and personally and I will continue to bring more and better music next year.",

I remember I didn't even want to listen to it again until a good told me that it's a beautiful remix and that it would be nice to release it, and now I feel like it's such a great track, NEVER feel bad about your creations!

And about this song, every song I make has a reason for being or a feeling attached to it about what I felt at that moment while making it, it's been a year since I met the nicest and most supportive and caring person I've ever met but we are really far from each other and we hope to get together someday soon, so this a classic Dimati's melodic dubstep style song with optimistic and hopeful vibes.",
