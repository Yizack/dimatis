So then let's consider first of all
what is a mind in the grip a vicious circles

Well one of the most obvious instances
that we all know is the phenomenon of worry

The doctor tells you
that you have to have an operation

And that has been set up so
that automatically everybody worries about it

But since worrying takes away
your appetite and your sleep

it's not good for you

so the doctor tells you not to worry

because he wants you in the operating table
in state of good health well rested etc

But you can't stop worrying

And therefore you get additionally worried
that you are worrying

And therefore will not be in the right shape
to be on the operating table

And then furthermore because
that is quite absurd

and your mad at yourself
because you do it,

you are worried because you worry
because you worry

That is a vicious circle
