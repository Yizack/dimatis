Ashes and rain fall all around
For all we've lost we can't account
Find strength to rise up off the ground
To stand again

Pure darkness reigns and all seems lost
We know our lives could be the cost
Find strength to rise despite the odds
To stand again

Oh, we're the hope that they stand on
Oh, all they have to depend upon
Oh, give our hearts to protect them
Oh, find it in us to stand again
To stand again

To stand again
To stand again
Oh, find it in us to stand again

This night we've surely met our fate
We'll keep the promises we made
Find strength to fight despite the pain
To stand again

Oh, we're the hope that they stand on
Oh, all they have to depend upon
Oh, give our hearts to protect them
Oh, be the heroes to stand again
To stand again

To stand again
To stand again
Oh, be the heroes to stand again

Oh, give our hearts to protect them
Oh, be the heroes to stand again
To stand again
