Each day's a struggle
To keep my head down and out of trouble
Not a soul could ever pop the bubble
That she's made here

I'm hiding in my bed longer each time
I feel I should never leave this rest
Sleep is easier than being awake I guess

It's loud out of the sheets
I swear I'm doing nothing wrong
Just let me go to school
And move on with my day

Downtown I feel at peace
No one could ever know my name
If I could I'd find all those who feel the same
And we could all go away

And we could all go away

Dad admitted
She wasn't like this at the beginning
Just for you I've been sticking with it
But she's changed

Ain't no reason to blame, this happens with time
She's still be your mother when I'm dead
So when we split we'll go live in a cloud instead

It's overwhelming, it's killing me holding this inside
I'm just a kid, I ain't ready this is impossible
All of my memories have threatened to go
I'm too slow to keep up, I feel tied up

Does it mean that I've actually messed it up
I didn't realize that I could be so powerful
And even though you can avoid screwing up
There's bad luck

It's loud out of the sheets
I swear I'm doing nothing wrong
Just let me go to school
And move on with my day

Downtown I feel at peace
No one could ever know my name
If I could I'd find all those who feel the same
And we could all go away

And we could all go away
