Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it

It was a long weekend
That left me wondering if we're still friends
We were sittin' in the hallway and
I never meant for it to get this way
It was a bit intense
And now I'm wondering
You left me wondering

But I just couldn't keep it bottled inside
Intense feels so hard to describe
If I knew that now, you wouldn't have turned the other way

I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm dreaming of
I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm thinking of
I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it

I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm dreaming of
I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm thinking of
I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it

Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
Now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it

It's like your eyes are glued
You're so interesting in your shoes
I try to look you in the eye but it's 
No use if you don't try to
So I'm taking back
Everything I said
I know I can't admit it

But I just couldn't keep it bottled inside 
Intense feels so hard to describe
If I knew that now, you wouldn't have turned the other way

I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm dreaming of
I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm thinking of
I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it

I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm dreaming of
I should said it all along and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
I never meant to turn you off
But you're the one I'm thinking of
I guess it's just a stupid love and now I'm paying for it, now I'm paying for it
