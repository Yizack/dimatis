Just a simple word
or melody thatâ€™s heard
will call us back into that
long forgotten world

Like an ancient spell,
a legend that we tell,
reminds us who we were and
returns us to ourselves

Thoughts of home so far away
As we walk the winding way
We will find the strength to stay
In the songs of yesterday

Far away

Strength to stay
 in the songs of yesterday

Thoughts of home so far away
As we walk the winding way
We will find the strength to stay
In the songs of yesterday

In the songs of yesterday
