One day I'll soar through the sky
Looking back, I wish I could see you again
In the world of unknowing despair
Some day I'll fly without pain

In every summer song
To being stuck in a daydream far too long
I remember back then
Now I don't know when but...
I'll feel normal again

I'll feel normal again

Someday... someday... someday...
Someday... someday...
Some day I'll fly again

Someday... someday...
Someday... someday...

Everything that I need
Is it's own coloured memory within our dreams
I've failed to see the light
I want to end this fight
Some day I'll walk with my friends

Someday... someday... someday...
Someday... someday...
Someday... someday... someday...
Someday... someday...
Some day I'll fly again

Someday... someday...
Someday... someday...

Some day I'll walk with my friends
