I wanna know you
Wanna feel how fast my heart would beat
If you, were close to me
I wanna show you
Wanna let you loose inside my brain
To see, if you'd run or stay

If you, were close to me

To see, if you'd run or stay

If you, were close to me
If you, were close to me
If you, were close to me
To see, if you'd run or stay

Or stay
If you, were close to me
If you, were close to me
To see, if you'd run or stay

If you, were close to me
To see, if you'd run or stay

If you, were close to me
If you, were close to me
If you, were close to me
To see, if you'd run

Or stay
Or stay
If you, were close to me
Or stay
Or stay
If you, were close to me
