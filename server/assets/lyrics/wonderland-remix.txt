Wouldn't you give the world to know the secrets of
living life and letting go?

Don't you ever try to fight what you feel
Down the hole, the rabbit hole
It's the key

come out and shine
come out and shine
come out and shine

And I pray
To the light
Inside of me

come out and shine
come out and shine
come out and shine

Take me to your world and I will follow you inside
Take me to your world and I will follow you inside

When the sky becomes the sea
We're all mad here, said the cat
and smiled away

Don't you ever try to fight what you feel
Take a bone from a dog
What remains?

And I pray
To the light
Inside of me

come out and shine
come out and shine
come out and shine

And I pray
To the light
Inside of me
Save me, save me so that I can feel
Save me, save me so that I can feel

Save me
Save me
So that my heart can smile
