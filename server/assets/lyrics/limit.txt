Why, would we ever be afraid of falling?
When the only place we have to go from here, is up

I can't be found
I'm in a loft
Too far from the ground
I look around
Through the iris
And search for guidance

But I am lost
I saw a face
Have our paths crossed?
Before in space

There will be a moment we define
As all the constellations realign

Everything we've known
Started with a vision
Put it into motion
Now you're really living
Bottled up control
There's no way we shouldn't have
What we couldn't have
We pushed right past the limit

We pushed right past the limit

Nothing this world has is built in our dreams
You must be hurled past the edge of your means

Everything we've known
Started with a vision
Put it into motion
Now you're really living
Bottled up control
There's no way we shouldn't have
What we couldn't have
We pushed right past the limit

Oh, we push past
We push past the limit
Oh, we pushed past
With all we had
Won't turn back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We pushed past
We're right past the limit

We're pushing past
Past it, oh
We're pushing further tonight
We're pushing further tonight

Fear is something we inhibit
Adhere not to live within it
Push past the limit
