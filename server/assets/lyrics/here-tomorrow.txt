Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah

Echoes from beyond the past
The seed is sowed
The spirit knows,
May it guide me for

I again, will wander far
And shape the path,
To meet again
On veiled horizons

Ah, ah
The wind is calling your name
A whisper of the souls who never leave you
Ah, ah
Collect your silver tears
And pray they disappear, tomorrow

Earth and ether to combine
The light, it shows
The dark, it knows, our tethers

Spirits haunt the restless mind
But seek to find
We'll meet again,
Can't you hear them?
 
Ah, ah
The wind is calling your name
A whisper of the souls who never leave you
Ah, ah
Collect your silver tears
And pray that we are here, tomorrow

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
The wind is calling your name

Ah, ah
Can't you hear the call?

Ah, ah
The wind is calling my name
A whisper of the souls who never leave you
Ah, ah
Collect your silver tears
And pray I reappear, tomorrow
