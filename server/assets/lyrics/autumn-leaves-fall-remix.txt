Memories spread into yellow and red and amber
The air is so crisp with nostalgia and bliss
The paths that we tread and the words that we said
Those mornings
Standing so tall, I remember it all
As the autumn leaves fall

As the autumn leaves fall
As the autumn leaves fall
As the autumn leaves fall

The seasons will change but our love stays the same
Year to year
I think of our plans only we understand
The wonders we'll see as we wander beneath those branches
Standing so tall, I dream of it all
As the autumn leaves fall

I remember it all
As the autumn leaves fall

As we become gold in the September cold, I'll warm you
Together we'll spin in the whimsical winds
As we descend, heart to heart, hand in hand
This moment
Standing so tall, I'll savor it all
As the autumn leaves fall

As the autumn leaves fall
As the autumn leaves fall
