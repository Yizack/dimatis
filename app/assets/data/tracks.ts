The speech lyrics of this track come from a quote from a quest in one of my favorite games ever called Runescape, I liked what it says and how deep it is so I wanted to make a song highlighting this phrase, the voice isn't from the game, only the phrase but I thought it would fit well with a text-to-speech voice.\nIn addition to the release, I'd like to announce that my logo has been refined, it was a tough decision to make after the previous one has represented my music and brand for 10 years but I think it was time for a little change, I wanted it to be as similar as possible to the old one so that it didn't feel off, but using the golden ratio to make it more harmonic and I think it looks great now. Hope you like the new music and the refined logo! üíô",

This song has a special meaning for me, 5 months ago I left behind my fear/phobia of getting on a plane, and I left my country for the first time on a 10 hours trip to France all alone, to meet my girlfriend and live with her for more than a month, everything was perfect and can't be happier. When I came back home after a hard and sobbing goodbye, I wrote the melody of this song, it makes me feel good that I'll be back with her soon again so I decided to release it before the end of the year üíô. In short, it's been a great year, both musically and personally and I will continue to bring more and better music next year.",

I remember I didn't even want to listen to it again until a good told me that it's a beautiful remix and that it would be nice to release it, and now I feel like it's such a great track, NEVER feel bad about your creations!
