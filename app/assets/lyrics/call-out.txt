(Wake up in the morning)
(And I ask myself)
(Thinking about where you might be)
(Cannot stop reliving when)
(You finally said goodbye)

Wake up in the morning
And I ask myself
Thinking about where you might be
Cannot stop reliving when
You finally said goodbye

I know it's too late
To even think about
The mistakes that we made
Can't apologize
I close my eyes
Hoping the pain will go away

And I can't seem to forget about it
No this love just won't go away
Don't think I'll forget about it

Every time the night sky is out, I'll call
When the stars come out tonight, I'll call
I call out to the moon
Call out for you

Call out for you
(Call out for you)
Call out for you

Reminisce the good times that we had
Those were the best days
Wishing we could go back and change the past
But I know the truth
Baby no matter what I do
You're not here
Still I look for you

And I can't seem to forget about it
No this love just won't go away
Don't think I'll forget about it

Every time the night sky is out, I'll call
When the stars come out tonight, I'll call
I call out to the moon
Call out for you

Call out for you
(Call out for you)
Call out for you

Calling for you
Babe, calling for you
To the moon
Calling for you

To the moon
Calling for you
