Some men in the night are talking
"Is she a girl? Is she a ghost?"
Trespass to follow, walking
Should I stay or
No I need to go

Some men in the night are talking
"Is she a girl? Is she a ghost?"
Trespass to follow, walking
Should I stay or
No I need to go
Sick whispers of rules on my body
Body talks and now I know
That I'm not safe around anybody here
But I'm not alone

So I'm a psychic, move me
Impress me with you mind
You know it's not so soothing
To know when and where you'll fall
And when the timeline seems to be
Temporary and illusive at all
Just come back to see me
No cards or crystal balls

Use me
My words are drugs relaxing
Use me
My words are drugs relaxing
Use me
My words are drugs relaxing
Use me
