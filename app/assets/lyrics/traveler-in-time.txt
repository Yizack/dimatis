It feels like
The world has stopped
Sparks floating off my fingertips
As I listen to the unknown sounds
Of the earth that stopped

Spinning
Spinning around
Like a waterfall
Spinning
Spinning around
Like a tornado

Drifting drifting
I catch myself grinning
As I watch the clock
Time cut short
I'm a traveler in time

Spinning
Spinning around
Like a waterfall
Like a tornado
Drifting
I catch myself grinning
As I watch the clock

I'm a traveler
I'm a traveler in time
Traveler
I'm a traveler in time

It feels like
The world has stopped
Sparks floating off my fingertips
As I listen to the unknown sounds
Of the earth
Of the earth that stopped

I'm a traveler
I'm a traveler in time
I'm a traveler
I'm a traveler in time

I'm a traveler in time

I'm a traveler

Traveler
I'm a traveler in time
Traveler
I'm a traveler in time
