You have already made the choice to help me return
That choice has passed
To agonize over the past cripples our thoughts of the future
Do not procrastinate for fear of what might have been
Or what might become
Your choices define you
You must learn to live with them all
Good and bad

To do anything else would make you a poor world guardian
World guardian

Your choices define you

World guardian

To do anything else would make you a poor world guardian
World guardian

World guardian
