Never ending
My search for truth
The search for you
Somewhere

Why?
Why cross the stars?
When we're lost in the ocean
Of our limited understanding

Were we mistaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?

(Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?)

Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there?
Who is out there?
Is anybody out there?

Is anybody out there?
Is anybody out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?

(Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken
Or is there other life out there?
Were we forsaken)
