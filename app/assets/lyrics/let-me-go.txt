Why did you fall out
Why did I forget
When is it enough
How should I deal with this
I need the you the most
Please don't let me go

Maybe I just need to move on
Maybe you were never the one
Will I one day
See your true soul
Open up to me
And brush it all off
Our troubled past and it will pay off
Let us heal and break free of our ego
Throw it out and fire away
It's the only way to make me stay

Darling you should know
I never had control

Maybe I just need to move on
Maybe you were never the one
Will I one day
See your true soul
Open up to me
And brush it all off
Our troubled past and it will pay off
Let us heal and break free of our ego
Throw it out and fire away
It's the only way to make me stay

I just want you to know
For me you'd be the one
